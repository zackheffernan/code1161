# CODE1161 Design Computing Homepage S1 2018

## Course Outline:

This course focuses on using programming as a means of  problem solving, storytelling and creative expression for people in non-computer science fields.
 
Programming is simultaneously a vocational skill, a branch of philosophy, a culture, and the glue that holds the modern world together. By the end of this course you will have the philosophical tools needed to **design solutions and the technical skill** to implement them.

In the same way that being able to hold a pen doesn't make you a writer, being able to type code doesn't make you a programmer. So we'll learn how to manipulate symbols (type code), what those symbols mean, and how to decide which symbols to type in the first place. We'll learn simple logic and strategies for decomposing problems. We'll learn about the history and culture of computers in general, and in art and architecture.

The course will be taught through three sections.
The first will be becoming proficient in the [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)).
Second is will be a machine learning project which utilises your newfound problem solving and programming skills.
The third section will be the Open Data Project: a data analysis and story telling telling task.

## Schedule
### Week 1: Welcome to CODE1161 and Your dev environment

#### Introduction

- **An introduction to the world of computing** as it is in 2018. This should provide some context to what this course aims to teach and why.

- **Learning the 3 step** process that will help to start your journey as a problem solver.
 
- Setting up your development environment.

#### Requirements

- Please bring a portable computer to the lab as you will be setting up your dev environment.
- An open mind and a willingness to trade some privacy for automation of boring tasks and quicker processes.

Attempt exercises in trinket.io if you have finished.

In the last hour we will familiarise ourselves with each bit of software we have installed and what purpose it serves in the course. After that we will cover how to write your lab books and push them to github.

#### Homework
- Ensure you have your dev environment set up.
- In the week1 folder, complete:
	- exercise1.py
	- write your journal in README.md

### Week 2: All of Python in three hours

#### Introduction

- This week we will obtain an overview of all the components of the Python syntax. Theoretically, you will be able to do __any__ programming task after this week ;-).

- More details about the development environment.

- How to ask questions and the three step process to general problem solving.

#### Requirements

- A portable computer.
- List of questions from last week's lab
- Maybe some snacks for the lab. Keep it low GI if you can.
